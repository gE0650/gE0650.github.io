# 9.27

Participated in a Linux ~~Inpart~~ Install Party and Freshman Parties for both gE's faculty and its province. Indeed all are brillant, yet its **sense of engagement** was lost, due to its style maybe.  

For long a complaint haunted in gE that maybe what it has been studying **doesn't make a difference**. But today it finds out a positive perspective: Turns out that the courses should be handy.  

Everything felt boring for gE, so it sought for advice from **rW**, who commented *BAK*. It decided to give it a try.  

~~Damn~~ gE's Eng is so awful.
