# 9.27

Participated in a Linux ~~Inpart~~ Install Party and Freshman Parties for both gE's faculty and its province. Indeed all are brillant, yet its **sense of engagement** was lost, due to its style maybe.  

For long a complaint haunted in gE that maybe what it has been studying **doesn't make a difference**. But today it finds out a positive perspective: Turns out that the courses should be handy.  

Everything felt boring for gE, so it sought for advice from **rW**, who commented *BAK*. It decided to give it a try.  

~~Damn~~ gE's Eng is so awful.

# 9.28

First time to connect to Clab from VScode, which enable using GUI inside VScode. Really helpful for beginners like gE. But now it needs to ssh to Clab first, then ssh again to Github.  

Found a plugin that can change the background of VSC, interesting.  

# 9.29

Trapped by mathematical analysis, did nothing interesting.  
Damn why hasn't gE modify the CV page?  

# 9.30

Installed *Ori and the Will of the Wisps*, plan to give it a try during the festival.  
Took a small bite of Vim today. Really uncomfortable for beginners like gE, as is declared in many instructions.
